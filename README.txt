 - Load folder into matlab
 - Run the script "fireflies.m"
 - Play around with the following four parameters at the top:

frequency = 5;
stimulation_gap = 4;
neighbour_dist = 0.1;
num_flies = 500;

 - If you run it as is, sometimes they all end up in sync and sometimes they struggle to agree
   and stay in local clusters.
 - Increase neighbour_dist and they will be more likely to become in sync.
